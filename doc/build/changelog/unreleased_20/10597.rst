    Fixed issue where use of :func:`_orm.foreign` annotation on a
    non-initialized :func:`_orm.mapped_column` construct would produce an
    expression without a type, which was then not updated at initialization
    time of the actual column, leading to issues such as relationships not
    determining ``use_get`` appropriately.
